        <h3>Fall 2017</h3>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I ended up with two A’s, two A- and a B+ in writing (darn non exam class!)!!!! Overall my GPA is 3.71 which was just over top 10% last year! (they don’t rank outside of top 10%). I’m extremely excited right now and super grateful for all the help through the semester. I couldn’t have done it without your insight and help through the practice tests, email handouts, and constant communication and support. Now i just need to repeat this semester!!!</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>Just wanted to say thank you. Your work was extremely helpful. I applied the comments you made on my last practice test and I got an A. He used my fucking answer as the sample answer. I appreciate what you’ve done to help me greatly and I’ll definitely pass on your name to others.</p>

            <p>(and a followup email a while later)</p>

            <p>3.89 Overall GPA. Another email because I can’t talk to my classmates. Damn Eric. The method works. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I wanted to let you know I ended the semester with a 4.0!</p>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I Finally got my grades back today (waiting for grades is almost worse than actually taking the exam).</p>
            <p>. . .</p>
            <p>I ended with an overall GPA of a 3.75, last year’s top 10 percent cutoff was a 3.70. So, I think I made it!</p>

        <h3>Fall 2016</h3>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I hope you have been well since we last emailed! It’s crazy looking back at these emails 7 months / a semester later – I can’t believe I was drafting such long emails in the middle of finals. First and foremost, I just wanted to update and thank you for your help during the fall. I ended up somewhere above the approx. 10% designation, and made law review. I think that your advice helped a lot – as you predicted, it came together more towards the end. Funnily, I ended up getting an A+ on the last exam we reviewed. I re-read your materials in the heat of second semester, when things were getting super busy, and realized that much of it was still internalized from the Fall! Moreover, I don’t think I expressed this to you during the semester, but your positive and knowing responses really helped with pre-exam anxiety (though as expected, there was still plenty of it all around!).</p>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>The long awaited moment has arrived and I got my grades. I ended up with a 3.78 which should place me comfortably within the top 10% for this first semester based off the class of 2018’s rankings. I just wanted to thank you for all of the help throughout the semester. Like I said before, I know I wouldn’t have done as well without your program, and my goal of transferring to a top 14 school is still within reach. I can’t thank you enough for everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I just wanted to say thank you for doing what you do. I would not have done as well in my classes had I not signed up for your course. I received my final grades and got an A in Torts, A in Civ Pro, A- in Contracts, and B+ in Legal writing which averaged out to a 3.8 and around top 5%.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I’m still waiting on my Contracts grade, but I thought I’d let you know how I’m faring so far. I’ve gotten two doctrinal grades back, Property and Torts, and I did better than I ever could have imagined. I got a high A in Property despite panicking all break because I missed a big issue. I got an A+ in Torts, possibly picking up a CALI award.</p>

            <p>This is all, of course, due to your class. You taught me what matters on a law school exam, and I mimicked it the best I could. It’s very possibly the best $900 I’ve ever spent.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help. Thank you for helping me even though I made you write out an answer to a Property practice exam when I was stuck. Thank you for being obsessed with law school exams and for passing the wisdom you’ve gained onto hopeful 1Ls.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I just received my grades and I am ecstatic. I did better than I expected, and I could not have done it without your help. I got A in Contracts, Civ Pro, Criminal Law and A- in Torts. Thanks so much!</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>Just got my second semester grades and they actually came back a little better than first semester. Gonna fire off some clerkship applications this summer, and hopefully something will come back. Wanted to just shoot you a message to thank you for all of your help. Can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.</p>

        <h3>Spring 2016</h3>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>Dear Eric,</p>

            <p>I just got my grades back from this semester and I wanted to let you know that I improved . . . to a 3.84!! I made two As and two A-s! It isn’t quite law review grade-on, but I really couldn’t be happier.</p>
            <p>. . .</p>
            <p>None of this would have been possible without your course and I just wanted to express my gratitude for all of your help and for creating this amazing course for law students who want to improve their grades. It works!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Fall 2015</h3>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>Hey Eric, it’s been a good long while since we last talked. Law school kinda swallowed me whole after October lol. Anyway, I just got my grades and wanted to thank you for all the study materials. I felt kinda bad after exams and thought median was the best i could hope for, but somehow I managed a line of B+, B+, A-, A-, A, which I honestly feel is better than I deserve, but no way am I giving the points back!</p>

            <p>I credit your coaching and materials for teaching me to think about exams in the right way (even if that involved a little bit of freaking out after each one), so thank you again.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I wanted to thank you for the course last Fall. It was a tremendous help to have some feedback early on in the process for how to write exams, particularly with the detail of how to rewrite certain sentences to maximize the arguments.</p>

            <p>We . . . just got our grades last week and I ended up doing pretty well – around top 10% I’d guess (tough to say with our grade inflation).</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>Super happy, 2 As and 1 A minus. Thank you so much for your help, couldn’t have done it without you. Thank you so much for listening to my bullshit and my ramblings.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Fall 2014</h3>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I was a student of TSL last year. I don’t want to give too much information about myself but I was a student at HYS and finished with what amounts to above a 4.0 (somewhere in the top 5-7%). If you really want substantial insight into the process of transforming how you read legal texts, digest cases, and then apply that knowledge in an exam situation, this is a superb program. 1L comes with an insane amount of anxiety and “herd blindness” with everyone scrambling to figure “it” out without many having any clue what “it” is. TSL cuts through the BS and helps distill where the focus of your energy should be. $900 may seem (and did seem) like a lot but when one considers the ridiculously high stakes of 1L year it makes much more sense. I’m happy to be PM’ed with any further questions.</p>

            <p>FWIW, I did end up with a feeder clerkship after 1L year and this was due almost entirely to my grades and the professor recommendations that I was able to get because of said grades in their classes.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="container testimonial-container">
            <p>I used Thesealocust in 2014 for my first semester of 1L and would highly recommend anyone who wants to get good grades take advantage of his program. I was personally thrilled to get a spot in his inaugural program before he ran out of spots–his law school exam obsession and expertise are incredible and he was well-known. I knew from reading his guides that he had dissected exam-taking skills (and, what’s more, how those skills are acquired by live law students) and I knew from lurking in his anti-anxiety thread that he cared genuinely about the mental sanity of the incurable neurotics matriculating at top law schools around the country. The opportunity to learn his ways more in-depth, to develop my skills from thorough and focused training and to sharpen them with personalized feedback on my own practice tests from a law school sensai offered such a return for my investment that, compared with the amounts of money at other points in the law school -> law firm process, choosing to take him up on this opportunity seemed like a no-brainer.</p>

            <p>In retrospect, it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. His guides and techniques gave me skills to ace law school exams, his feedback identified areas to work on and he followed up with suggestions about how to work on them. After first semester, I was comfortably within the top 1 or 2 percent of GPAs at my school (a T14) and I did just as well second semester, even though I didn’t work as hard, because I had already learned the skills. You really don’t have to work as hard as everyone seems to think; you just need to know where to focus your energy. That is probably the primary benefit of using Thesealocust: he helps guide the steering wheel of your 1L car to keep you focused on the finish line which saves you fuel, time and sanity.</p>

            <p>I say the technical guidance is probably the primary benefit of using this service because it is truly hard to overstate another upside to using Thesealocust: the mental health benefits of having a law school guru guide you through what is important and what isn’t, what matters and what doesn’t, when you should be working hard and when you would be better off at bar review are immense and worth the price of admission alone. Being constantly reassured that it’s normal to feel like you don’t get it by someone who felt the same way and nevertheless got where you want to go is the best possible antidote for the sometimes toxic nature of going through 1L.</p>

            <p>I had, I confess, spent much of my 0L summer reading the TLS guides, the books that the TLS guides reference, and the books that those books reference, going through programs and E&amp;Es and whatever I could find that promised to help me through my 1L. Thesealocust taught me more than all of that stuff combined. You see, he’s gone through that stuff too. A lot of it isn’t great advice and even more of it is hard to appreciate until you’re sufficiently far along in your training, but Thesealocust has taken the parts you need and created a program that gives you things to do right when you need them: no sooner, no later. If it weren’t for Thesealocust I don’t know how I would have done, but I’m 100% certain I would not have done as well as I did. As it was, I did pretty much exactly what he suggested and wound up right around the top of the class, so I’m absolutely certain that I would use him again.</p>

            <p>The only downside is being on Law Review.</p>

            <p>This guy is good at helping you get points. Take his course.</p>

            <p>I wish I could write a more eloquent review, but that’s already been done. I don’t want to give away everything he taught me, but your best resource for Exam Q&amp;A is paying for his course and spamming his inbox.</p>
